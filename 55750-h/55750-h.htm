<p><span class='sc'>A. G. Spalding</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Anticipating the present tendency
of the American people
toward a healthful method of living
and enjoyment, Spalding’s Athletic
Library was established in 1892 for
the purpose of encouraging athletics
in every form, not only by
publishing the official rules and
records pertaining to the various
pastimes, but also by instructing,
until to-day Spalding’s Athletic
Library is unique in its own particular
field and has been conceded
the greatest educational series on
athletic and physical training subjects
that has ever been compiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>The publication of a distinct
series of books devoted to athletic
sports and pastimes and designed
to occupy the premier place in
America in its class was an early
idea of Mr. A. G. Spalding, who
was one of the first in America
to publish a handbook devoted to
athletic sports, Spalding’s Official
Base Ball Guide being the initial
number, which was followed at intervals with other handbooks on the
sports prominent in the ’70s.</p>

<p class='c000'>Spalding’s Athletic Library has had the advice and counsel of Mr. A. G.
Spalding in all of its undertakings, and particularly in all books devoted
to the national game. This applies especially to Spalding’s Official
Base Ball Guide and Spalding’s Official Base Ball Record, both of which
receive the personal attention of Mr. A. G. Spalding, owing to his early
connection with the game as the leading pitcher of the champion Boston
and Chicago teams of 1872–76. His interest does not stop, however, with
matters pertaining to base ball; there is not a sport that Mr. Spalding
does not make it his business to become familiar with, and that the
Library will always maintain its premier place, with Mr. Spalding’s able
counsel at hand, goes without saying.</p>

<p class='c000'>The entire series since the issue of the first number has been under
the direct personal supervision of Mr. James E. Sullivan, President
of the American Sports Publishing Company, and the total series of
consecutive numbers reach an aggregate of considerably over three
hundred, included in which are many “annuals,” that really constitute
the history of their particular sport in America year by year, back copies
of which are even now eagerly sought for, constituting as they do the
really first authentic records of events and official rules that have ever
been consecutively compiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Spalding’s Athletic Library was founded, seventeen years ago,
track and field athletics were practically unknown outside the larger
colleges and a few athletic clubs in the leading cities, which gave occasional
meets, when an entry list of 250 competitors was a subject of comment;
golf was known only by a comparatively few persons; lawn tennis
had some vogue and base ball was practically the only established field
sport, and that in a professional way; basket ball had just been invented;
athletics for the schoolboy—and schoolgirl—were almost unknown, and
an advocate of class contests in athletics in the schools could not get a
hearing. To-day we find the greatest body of athletes in the world is
the Public Schools Athletic League of Greater New York, which has had
an entry list at its annual games of over two thousand, and in whose
“elementary series” in base ball last year 106 schools competed for the
trophy emblematic of the championship.</p>

<p class='c000'>While Spalding’s Athletic Library cannot claim that the rapid growth
of athletics in this country is due to it solely, the fact cannot be denied
that the books have had a great deal to do with its encouragement, by
printing the official rules and instructions for playing the various games
at a nominal price, within the reach of everyone, with the sole object
that its series might be complete and the one place where a person
could look with absolute certainty for the particular book in which he
might be interested.</p>

<p class='c000'>In selecting the editors and writers for the various books, the leading
authority in his particular line has been obtained, with the result
that no collection of books on athletic subjects can compare with
Spalding’s Athletic Library for the prominence of the various authors
and their ability to present their subjects in a thorough and practical
manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>A short sketch of a few of those who have edited some of the leading
numbers of Spalding’s Athletic Library is given herewith:</p>

    <div>WALTER CAMP</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>For quarter of a century Mr. Walter Camp
of Yale has occupied a leading position in college
athletics. It is immaterial what organization
is suggested for college athletics, or for
the betterment of conditions, insofar as college
athletics is concerned, Mr. Camp has always
played an important part in its conferences,
and the great interest in and high plane of
college sport to-day, are undoubtedly due more
to Mr. Camp than to any other individual. Mr.
Camp has probably written more on college
athletics than any other writer and the leading papers and magazines
of America are always anxious to secure his expert opinion on foot
ball, track and field athletics, base ball and rowing. Mr. Camp has grown
up with Yale athletics and is a part of Yale’s remarkable athletic system.
While he has been designated as the “Father of Foot Ball,” it is a well-known
fact that during his college career Mr. Camp was regarded as one
of the best players that ever represented Yale on the base ball field, so
when we hear of Walter Camp as a foot ball expert we must also remember
his remarkable knowledge of the game of base ball, of which he is a
great admirer. Mr. Camp has edited Spalding’s Official Foot Ball Guide
since it was first published, and also the Spalding Athletic Library book
on How to Play Foot Ball. There is certainly no man in American college
life better qualified to write for Spalding’s Athletic Library than Mr.
Camp.</p>

  <h2 class='c017'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>❧</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Oh, do you remember, how, when a small boy
in the country, in the months of April, May, June,
July, August and September (it mattered little what
time of the year it was, just so the ice was out of
the water), you used to run to the river at a
“twelve-second gait,” make two simple twists of
the wrist, thereby removing a waist and pair of
trousers, and plunge into the water with speed
equalled only by the rapidity with which you say
your prayers on a cold night? Of course you do.
Great fun, was it not? I used to think there was
nothing like it. I could not get into the water
quick enough. That was before I learned to turn
the “back” and the “flip,” however.</p>

<p class='c000'>After I learned to turn the back and forward
somersault, when I was about eleven years old, I
would linger on the bank, or soft sandy beach,
“tumbling,” until I saw the other boys coming
out to dress, then I would dive in, swim a few
strokes, just to say I had been in swimming, come
out and dress with the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Like the proverbial “Wandering Willie,” the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>water lost much of its charm for me after I found
what royal fun the turning and twisting on the
bank afforded. I have wondered many times if
the Almighty, when He created beaches like Manhattan,
Rockaway and Nantasket, making them
slope gently down to the water, and put the soft,
but not too soft, yielding sand there, if He did not
think how admirable they would be to “tumble” on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any one who has experienced the pleasure of a
few “backs,” “flips,” “snap-ups,” etc., on the soft
sand, immediately after donning the light bathing
suit, will agree with me that it is “great fun.”
And he who has never been taught, never practiced
any acrobatic work, I hope will begin “easy” at
first; a few simple feats and practice carefully every
opportunity he has.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am sure whoever takes an interest, tries, and
advances as far as the “round-off,” “flip” and
“back,” will feel fully repaid for all the time passed
in learning. He will find so many opportunities of
performing, and it will be a means of great pleasure
to himself, if not to his friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the acts can be performed in the parlor
or in a very small space. However, they should
never be <em>practiced</em> in the parlor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now a few words upon the benefits, physical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>and mental, derived from practicing tumbling.</p>

<p class='c000'>An expert tumbler has an everlasting faculty of
always landing on his feet. If thrown from a
horse, street car or carriage, like a cat that is
dropped from a window, and the man who strikes
a match on the sole of his boot, he always lights
on his feet. There is a sort of wriggle or twist
that a man who has practiced tumbling long can
make in the air that will invariably bring him
down feet first.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mental benefit is derived from the pleasure
found in practicing, as all recreation is a mental
benefit. I feel that all I could preach, say or sing
about the benefit of any certain exercise would be
feeble indeed. Boys and young men—and they
are the ones who will probably be most interested
in this book—are not appealed to by advice on
“what they ought to do.” They will never practice
any of the feats described in this book for the
good it will do them. They know that plenty of
sleep is good for them, and they know that tobacco
is bad for them; but it makes no difference.</p>

<p class='c000'>This book is intended more for the boy who
wishes to learn but does not know just where and
how to begin. What we all need in this world is
encouragement. I should like to encourage every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>boy who wishes to learn. Don’t be discouraged
because it takes you so long to learn the handspring;
when that is once learned, the other acts
will be easier.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do you remember the comparative lines used by
a baking powder company in advertising their
baking powder? There was the long line reaching
nearly across the page, representing this firm’s
powder, “Absolutely Pure.” Then there was the
next line, not as long, representing some other
firm’s powder—not as long a line, and not so pure
a powder. Then there were other lines along
down the list, shorter and shorter, until the last,
which was only about an eighth of an inch long.
Now, I think these lines might serve as an excellent
illustration of the length of time it will require
one to learn the different feats. Let the long line
represent the length of time it takes to acquire the
first trick; the practice for the first trick will help
you with the second, the second with the third,
and so on, so that when you have practiced and
learned many feats the time required to learn each
will grow shorter and shorter, although the acts
grow harder.</p>

<p class='c000'>This rule will apply to all athletic and gymnastic
work as well as to tumbling.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>To boys who are apt to get discouraged I love
to tell of a boy I knew in Chicago. He was far
below the average in natural ability when I first
knew him—awkward and clumsy—but he became
interested in gymnastic work and kept “everlastingly
at it.” He fairly lived in the gymnasium.
As a result of this faithful labor, in less than three
months’ time he participated in a gymnastic exhibition,
turning a forward somersault through a
blazing hoop.</p>

<p class='c000'>Practice, don’t be discouraged! You will probably
never become as great an acrobat as one of
the Nelson Brothers, but you will certainly find
great pleasure and accomplish some good results
by Ground Tumbling.</p>

  <h2 class='c017'>DIRECTIONS</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>❧</div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c018'><em>1. The Switch.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>This is an act which is easily performed and
affords much amusement for spectators. Stand in
an erect position with hands hanging at sides,
spring up a foot-and-a-half from the ground and
give a quick jerk or switch with the body and
come down facing in the opposite direction. Do
not jump around. The turn is made by a twist
of the body, not with the feet or legs.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i_029.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>No. 2. <span class='sc'>The Sitdown.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c018'><em>2. The Sit Down.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Stand with the feet about one foot apart, bend
over, keeping the legs perfectly straight, until the
finger tips nearly touch the toes, then fall back to
a sitting position on the floor. Do not bend
the knees. If performed correctly this can be done
on a very hard floor without hurting the performer
in the least. (See illustration.)</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>3. The Back Roll.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Performed the same as No. 2, only instead of
stopping at the sitting position the performer rolls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>back on the shoulders and head, and with the use
of the hands comes to a standing position on feet.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i_031.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>No. 4. <span class='sc'>The Fish Flop.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><em>4. The Fish Flop.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Lie on stomach, feet close together with the toes
touching the floor. Place hands on sides, near
ribs, flop over onto back with help of hands and
feet, keeping the body perfectly rigid. (See illustration.)</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>5. The Front Roll.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Stand with heels close together, toes turned out.
Bend over, place hands on floor about one foot
apart and about a foot-and-a-half in front of feet,
bend head in toward body and touch the back
of head on floor between hands and, with a push
from the feet, roll over on back and up onto feet
again. “Curl up” in doing this act. Bring feet
well under body.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>6. The Cart Wheel.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Stand erect, throw left hand hard down on the
floor, about two feet from the left foot, follow with
the right hand, two feet from the left hand, then
the right foot down about two feet from the right
hand, and so on. The feet and hands should be
placed as nearly on a straight line as possible.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Arms and legs moving like the spokes in a wheel,
hence the name.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><em>7. The Round-off.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>This may be done with either running or standing
start. Strike hands on ground in front of feet,
letting the left strike a little before the right, as in
the cart-wheel. Place them about ten inches
apart, at the same time swing the body over and
around, so as to land in a sitting position directly
opposite the one in starting.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>8. The Handspring.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Possibly the most common acrobatic feat. May
be done from running or standing start; strike
hands hard on the ground, turn head under and in,
throw feet over head and as they begin to come
down give a hard spring or push up with the
hands, curling feet down and back under body
and coming to standing position, facing the same
way as when starting.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>9. The One-hand Handspring.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Same as No. 8, except that but one hand is used.
The weight of the body should be brought well
over the hand used.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
<img src='images/i_033.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>No. 10. <span class='sc'>The Headspring.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c018'><em>10. The Headspring.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Instructions same as for No. 8, only the spring
is made from the head instead of the hands. (See
illustration.)</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/i_035.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>No. 11. <span class='sc'>The Snap Up.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c018'><em>11. The Snap Up.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Lie on back, carry feet up and back over head
so that the toes nearly touch the ground, bearing
the weight on the back of head, neck and shoulders.
The hands should be placed on the ground
near shoulders and neck. Give a quick hard whip
with the feet and legs over toward first position
and a hard snap or push up with the neck, shoulders
and hands. With a little practice it can be
done without the aid of the hands. It is a pretty
act and a good “finish” to every act ending with
a fall on the back. (See illustration.)</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>12. The Elephant Walk.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>A comical contortion act. Place hands on floor
in front of feet as near to toes as possible. Do not
bend the knees. Walk.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>13. The Long Dive or Lion’s Leap.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>This is a long dive made on the mats or some
soft place, much as one dives into the water.
Take a short run, strike both feet at the same time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>on a spot about five feet from the mat, make a
dive toward the centre of the mat striking first the
hands, then the head (which should be well turned
down and under), allowing the force of the dive to
be about equally divided between the hands, neck,
head and shoulders. Curl up well as in No. 5.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><em>14. The Hop Over Hand and Foot.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Grasp left foot with right hand, with thumb of
right hand under great toe joint; fingers of right
hand over top of toes with backs of fingers up.
Jump over hand and foot with right foot. The
point to be observed in performing this trick is to
keep the right hand and left foot perfectly still
while jumping with the right. If moved, they are
apt to trip the foot when jumping. This is excellent
practice in developing quickness in handling
the feet, which is an important factor in tumbling.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>15. The Hop Back.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Jump back to original position from finish of No.
14. Try the same trick with both feet over and
back.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>16. The Jump Over Stick in Hands.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Practice this with a cane or rattan that can be
bent down while jumping over. Grasp stick with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>ordinary grasp, hands placed as far apart as the
width of shoulders. Jump over stick between
hands, keeping stick in hands. Jump back.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><em>17. The Jump Over Hat.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Same as No. 16, except jump is made over hat
held in hands.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>18. The Jump Over Razor-Blade.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>This should never be practiced until the performer
can successfully jump over short lead pencil
held in hands. It is a “stage trick” that takes well
and usually makes a hit. It should be done with a
razor-blade so dull that if struck with the feet it
would do no harm. Hold the blade of the razor in
the hands so loosely that if tripped upon by toes it
would easily slip from hands without injury.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id009'>
<img src='images/i_037.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>No. 19. <span class='sc'>The Jump Over Hands.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c018'><em>19. The Jump Over Hands.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>This is one of the prettiest and most difficult acts
that is performed. Entwine the fingers together
and jump through the arms and over the hands.
It may take months of practice to get this feat, but,
when once learned, the legs will be so supple and
quick that nearly all other acrobatic feats will come
easier in consequence. (See illustration.)</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><em>20. The Twist Handspring.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Performed the same as No. 8, only, after touching
the hands, the body gives a quick turn or
twist to the right or left so as to finish the act
facing in position used in starting.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>21. The Twist Snap-Up.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Same as No. 11, only the body gives a quick
turn or twist to the right or left after the shoulders
leave the ground so that the finish is made opposite
the position taken in starting.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>22. The Cradle.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>First do the snap-up, No. 11, and immediately
after landing fall back onto the shoulders, neck,
head and hands as in the snap-up, then snap back
to feet and continue to rock back and forth.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>23. The Kicking Jackass.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Stand with heels close together, jump onto
hands, with the feet carried well back and the
back arched. Then spring (not fall) back to the
feet from the hands and continue the movement.
Be sure that the feet leave and strike the ground
together, also the hands. Do not “crow-hop,”
that is, don’t strike first one foot and then the
other, a sort of “ker-flap,” “pit-pat” sound.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
<img src='images/i_039.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>No. 24. <span class='sc'>The Curl.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c018'><em>24. The Curl.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Stand erect, fall slowly forward on the hands,
keeping the body perfectly straight. Break the
force of the fall by letting the arms bend slightly,
but straighten them immediately. Curl up, bringing
the knees well up toward the chin and carry
the feet through between the hands, not letting
them touch the floor; extend legs in front of arms,
curl up again, carry feet back through hands and
straighten into the “handstand.” This is a difficult
feat, but it may be practiced with perfect
safety. It is excellent practice for developing the
muscles of the stomach and abdomen. (See illustration.)</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i_041.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>No. 25. <span class='sc'>Running Forward Somersault.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c018'><em>25. Running Forward Somersault.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Take a quick run of about twenty yards, strike
both feet together on the mat or floor. Jump well
into the air, duck the head down and in, and try
to describe a half circle through the air, with the
feet landing in a position, the same direction as
when starting. It is well to practice this over a
very soft place, having a board or some hard object
to turn from and land into hay, shavings, soft sand,
sawdust or tan-bark. When one has a soft place
on which to practice he should go at it boldly; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>will then be less apt to jar himself. A quick hard
run is the important thing, and a leap of about five
feet should be made before striking the take-off.
(See illustration.)</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>26. The Back Somersault.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>This is done from a standing position. Get two
men to hold you up while trying. The “lungers”
that are generally used in the gymnasium—“coward-strap”
they are called—may be used with
perfect safety. However, I think the best kind of
strap is a long strong towel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stand firmly with the heels about four inches
apart, spring up as high as possible, throw the
head back and down and try to describe a half
circle with the feet landing in a position facing the
same way as when starting. This should be
performed with a “cut,” that is when the feet get
well over the head catch the legs back of the
knees and pull them down under the body. The
way of using the hands in performing the back
somersault will gradually come to the performer
with practice.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>27. The Flip.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Sometimes called “Back Handspring.” Should
be practiced over a moderately soft place. Stand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>with the back to the mat. Sink down so that
knees come within a foot of the floor in front
of feet. Throw the hands and head back. Strike
hands on floor, about six inches apart, in a
position such as is held while walking on hands.
Do not let the head touch the ground. Then
throw the feet up over the head and hands, describing
a half circle, finishing facing the same way
as when starting. Use the stomach and abdomen
muscles when performing this act. Do not let the
feet leave the ground until the hands are firmly
placed.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>28. The Twister.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>This is No. 26, the back somersault, with a half
turn to the right or left, so that the finish is made
facing in an opposite position from the position
in starting. It is well in practising this act to
try and turn just a little at first, then an inch
further, and so on until the complete half turn is
made.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>29. The Twist Flip.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Same as No. 27, the “flip,” only a half turn is
made from the hands so as to finish facing in an
opposite direction from that taken when starting.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><em>30. The Spotter.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>This is the back somersault turned in such a
way as to finish with the feet in the same spot
they were when starting. It is best acquired by
trying to make each finish nearer and nearer to the
starting position.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>31. The Gainer.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Same as No. 30, except that the finish is made
with the feet striking in front of the starting position.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>32. The Tuck-up.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>This is a high back somersault performed without
the “cut.” It is usually done as a finish to a
succession of “flips.”</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>33. The Standing Forward.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>This is the forward somersault performed without
a run. To do this one must jump high into
the air, turning as he would in the running forward
and “cut” by catching the legs in front, just
above the ankles, and drawing them under the
ankles. It is a difficult act.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><em>34. The Half Forward.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>The first part of this act is performed as in No.
25, only, instead of having the feet describe a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>circle over the head, they stop in the air above
head, and the landing is made on the hands. It
is, in fact, a sort of jump or dive on the hands and
stand there.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_043.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>No. 35. <span class='sc'>The Half Back.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c018'><em>35. The Half Back.</em></h3>

<p class='c019'>Like No. 26, only the finish is made onto the
hands and the body balanced there. Instead of
turning all the way around, jump back onto the
hands and stand there. (See illustration.)</p>

<p class='c000'>This concludes the article on “single acts.” In
the next chapter I will describe how the acts can
be suitably combined. A clever performer can
make combinations other than these. In fact,
there are an endless variety of combinations that
can be made with the acts here described. Space
will not allow of a longer or more thorough description.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One of the aims of
physical training is to
make exercise interesting
and enjoyable. To be
beneficial in the highest
sense it must be recreative.
Particularly is this
true of physical exercise
for business men. As a
class, in their daily work,
they are kept on a constant
mental strain. Besides,
they are, to a large
degree, physically inactive.
Life becomes too
intense, too serious, too
sordid. Exercise therefore,
for business men,
must be largely recreative,
relaxing and restful.”—<em>Extract

in a furnace. Pile on the coal and shut off the draught and you kill the fire. Continue to
eat heavy meals and take no exercise and your health will be affected, not because of the
food you have eaten so much as on account of the lack of exercise. A little exercise is all

If its

correct its action.
The means
used to produce the resistance is a simple friction
clutch, which takes instant hold at the commencement
of the stroke and retains the pressure
till its completion, when it instantly releases
it precisely as in a boat. Quickly taken
apart without loosening any bolts or screws.
Each machine is adjustable to any amount of

    <div><b>Suitable alike for the Athlete or the ordinary Man or Woman</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The ideal boat for home use and
training purposes. Used by the leading
athletic clubs, colleges and prominent
oarsmen of the world, and pronounced
the most perfect rowing machine ever
produced. Fitted with the Kerns’ Patent Roller Seat and Shoes, the shoes
having a three-inch adjustment, to suit either a tall or a short person. By turning
a thumb-nut the belt can be tightened to any desired degree, and more or less friction
thrown into the running parts, imitating the resistance which exists when forcing a
row-boat through the water. The weaker sex can use the machine by simply loosening the thumb-nut which
reduces the resistance; and on the other hand, by reversing the operation the resistance can be so increased
that the strongest athlete can have any amount of resistance. The oars are pivoted in such a way that the operator
can handle and turn them the same as he would during the return and feathering motion with a boat oar.</p>

<p>Three Lockers In Single Tier</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><b>Wooden lockers are objectionable</b>,
because they attract vermin, absorb odors,
can be easily broken into, and are dangerous
on account of fire.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>Lockers made from wire mesh or
expanded metal afford little security</b>,
as they can be easily entered with wire cutters.
Clothes placed in them become covered
with dust, and the lockers themselves present
a poor appearance, resembling animal cages.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>Durand-Steel Lockers</b> are made of finest
grade furniture steel and are finished with
gloss black, furnace-baked japan (400°), comparable
to that used on hospital ware, which will never flake
off nor require refinishing, as do paints and enamels.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>Durand-Steel Lockers</b> are usually built with
doors perforated full length in panel design with sides
and backs solid. This prevents clothes in one locker
from coming in contact with wet garments
in adjoining lockers, while plenty of ventilation
is secured by having the door perforated
its entire length, but, if the purchaser
prefers, we perforate the backs also.</p>

<p class='c000'><b>The cost of Durand-Steel Lockers
is no more than that of first-class
wooden lockers</b>, and they last as long
as the building, are sanitary, secure, and,
in addition, are fire-proof.</p>

    <div>Standard Policy</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c006'>A Standard Quality must be inseparably linked to a Standard Policy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without a definite and Standard Mercantile Policy, it is impossible for a manufacturer to long
maintain a Standard Quality.</p>

<p class='c000'>To market his goods through the jobber, a manufacturer must provide a profit for the jobber as
well as the retail dealer. To meet these conditions of Dual Profits, the manufacturer is obliged to
set a proportionately high list price on his goods to the consumer.</p>

<p class='c000'>To enable the glib salesman, when booking his orders, to figure out attractive profits to both the
jobber and retailer, these high list prices are absolutely essential; but their real purpose will have been
served when the manufacturer has secured his order from the jobber, and the jobber has secured his
order from the retailer.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, these deceptive high list prices are not fair to the consumer, who does not, and, in
reality, is not ever expected to pay these fancy list prices.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the season opens for the sale of such goods, with their misleading but alluring high list
prices, the retailer begins to realize his responsibilities, and grapples with the situation as best he
can, by offering “special discounts,” which vary with local trade conditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under this system of merchandising, the profits to both the manufacturer and the jobber are
assured; but as there is no stability maintained in the prices to the consumer, the keen competition
amongst the local dealers invariably leads to a demoralized cutting of prices by which the profits of
the retailer are practically eliminated.</p>

<p class='c000'>This demoralization always reacts on the manufacturer. The jobber insists on lower, and still
lower, prices. The manufacturer, in his turn, meets this demand for the lowering of prices by the
only way open to him, viz.: the cheapening and degrading of the quality of his product.</p>

<p class='c000'>The foregoing conditions became so intolerable that, ten years ago, in 1899, A. G. Spalding
&amp; Bros. determined to rectify this demoralization in the Athletic Goods Trade, and inaugurated what
has since become known as “The Spalding Policy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The “Spalding Policy” eliminates the jobber entirely, so far as Spalding Goods are concerned,
and the retail dealer secures his supply of Spalding Athletic Goods direct from the manufacturer
under a restricted retail price arrangement by which the retail dealer is assured a fair, legitimate and
certain profit on all Spalding Athletic Goods, and the consumer is assured a Standard Quality and is
protected from imposition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “Spalding Policy” is decidedly for the interest and protection of the users of Athletic Goods,
and acts in two ways:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>First</span>—The user is assured of genuine Official Standard Athletic Goods, and
the same fixed prices to everybody.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Second</span>—As manufacturers, we can proceed with confidence in purchasing at
the proper time, the very best raw materials required in the manufacture
of our various goods, well ahead of their respective seasons, and this enables
us to provide the necessary quantity and absolutely maintain the Spalding
Standard of Quality.</p>

<p class='c000'>All retail dealers handling Spalding Athletic Goods are required to supply consumers at our
regular printed catalogue prices—neither more nor less—the same prices that similar goods are sold
for in our New York, Chicago and other stores.</p>

<p class='c000'>All Spalding dealers, as well as users of Spalding Athletic Goods, are treated exactly alike, and no
special rebates or discriminations are allowed to anyone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Positively, nobody; not even officers, managers, salesmen or other employes of A. G. Spalding
&amp; Bros., or any of their relatives or personal friends, can buy Spalding Athletic Goods at a discount
from the regular catalogue prices.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, briefly, is the “Spalding Policy,” which has already been in successful operation for the
past ten years, and will be indefinitely continued.</p>

<p class='c000'>In other words, “The Spalding Policy” is a “square deal” for everybody.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
